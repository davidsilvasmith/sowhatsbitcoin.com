#### Bitcoin is a breakthrough that can change your **career**.


Bitcoin is a computer science break through. Bitcoin's core innovation is a distributed ledger that is unforgeable. Basically it works like bittorrent but for sending and receiving payments.

#### Getting Started
    
1. Satoshi's 8 page [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) will give a concise explanation of bitcoin.
2. Buy $5 worth of bitcoin at [Coinbase](/for-individuals/buy/)
3. The company Blockchain.info has an easily consumable [API](https://blockchain.info/api) to program against. Incidentally most consumer facing companies like [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com) and [BitPay](http://www.bitpay.com) have APIs as well

#### Getting Help

1. Bitcoin has it's own [StackExchange](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) for bitcoin related questions. Keep programming questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Bitcoin Talk](https://bitcointalk.org/) is a great forum for asking in depth questions and seeing the latest news.
