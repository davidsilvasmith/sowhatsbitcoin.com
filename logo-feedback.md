#### New Logo is in Progress

I'm working on a logo to replace the current So Whats bitcoin logo ![current logo](/images/img_src.png "current logo").

I want the new logo to look more modern and communicate either confusion around bitcoin, since the site helps solve the confusion, or to demonstrate that it explains bitcoin.

I'm working with a designer on these two concepts, but I'm wondering which concept works better?

Here are **drafts** of the concept below:

___

#### Owl
