	<li>Who controls bitcoin? Bitcoin is controlled by the users of the system. New software changes must be voluntarily used by bitcoin users.</li>
	<li>How are bitcoins made? Bitcoins are created through a process called mining. The best way to think of it is like a lottery that gives out a prize (bitcoin) every ten minutes. The more tickets someone has the higher their chance of winning. The major difference is that instead of lottery tickets it is computing power (hashing power) that gives a chance to win. The more power the more chance of winning.</li>
