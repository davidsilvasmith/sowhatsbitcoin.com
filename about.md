#### Why this Site?
Everyone should understand bitcoin's amazing potential. Most websites are full of tech jargon. The lack of plain language websites is robbing non-techies of the opportunity to understand this technology which could [change their life](http://www.businessinsider.com/man-buys-bitcoin-forgets-about-it-remembers-finds-a-fortune-2013-10).

#### Four reasons to <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Bitcoin
1. Bitcoin is the easiest way to send and receive money online.
2. Bitcoin is designed to retain value. A US dollar in 1900 has 4 cents of purchasing power today. Money should retain value like gold.
3. Bitcoin is early in its life and has the potential to reach a market cap thousands of times higher than where it is now. Today's investors might be like the [guy](http://www.businessinsider.com/man-buys-bitcoin-forgets-about-it-remembers-finds-a-fortune-2013-10) who invested $27 into Bitcoin and had over $500,000 a couple years later.
4. Bitcoin protects us from our governments giving us freedom of [expression](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/08/20/wikileaks-bypasses-financial-blockade-with-bitcoin/), enabling us to [defend](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/07/12/kim-dotcoms-pretrial-legal-funds-would-be-safe-with-bitcoin/) ourselves, and allowing us to avoid [capital controls](http://forexmagnates.com/bitcoins-soar-in-value-in-argentina-due-to-capital-control-laws-bitcoin-meetup-held-in-nations-capital/).
