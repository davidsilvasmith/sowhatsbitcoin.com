# Why this Site?
Everyone should understand bitcoin's amazing potential. Most websites are full of tech jargon. The lack of plain language websites is robbing non-techies of the opportunity to understand this technology which could [change their life](http://www.businessinsider.com/man-buys-bitcoin-forgets-about-it-remembers-finds-a-fortune-2013-10).

# Four reasons to <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Bitcoin
1. Bitcoin is the easiest fastest way to send and receive money online.
2. Bitcoin is early in its life and will potentially be valued hundreds of times higher than where it is now. Today's investors might be like the [guy](http://www.businessinsider.com/man-buys-bitcoin-forgets-about-it-remembers-finds-a-fortune-2013-10) who invested $27 into Bitcoin and had over $500,000 four years later.
3. Bitcoin lets people do things no other form of money can. 
 * Any charity can accept money through a QR code. That means a printed sign, a sign shown on tv, a business card - all these mediums are now potential donation channels for the charity to instantly receive dollars or bitcoins.
 * Using [ChangeTip](http://www.changetip.com) on Twitter one can send $5 to someone in Japan who can then send $5 to someone in [Kreuzberg, Berlin](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/26/bitcoins-gain-currency-in-berlin) who can then buy a sandwich with bitcoin, all within the span of 5 minutes. That is impossible with all other payment systems today. 
 * Another use case is being able to raise startup funds through [crowdsales](http://blog.mastercoin.org/2014/06/03/upcoming-crowd-sales-worth-tens-of-millions-of-dollars/)
 * A future use case will be enabling people to sell stock purchased through a brokerage, like AAPL, at a Christmas dinner to a family member.
 * Another future use case is being able to have software auto execute a will. Instead of having lawyers and probate, upon death all assets could be distributed exactly as the owner wanted within seconds of the death being recorded.
4. Bitcoin enables micropayments. Through bitcoin it is possible to pay cents and even fractions of a cent for services. Entire new payment models will emerge. For example paying for WiFi at an airport or restaurant, paying to read articles online, all kinds of services that are ad funded could be paid directly by the consumer, aligning the incentives of the producer and consumer.
