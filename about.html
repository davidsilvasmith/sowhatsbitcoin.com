<h2>Why did you Create this Site?</h2>
<p>I want everyone to understand bitcoin's amazing potential. Last year I become obsessed with bitcoin learning all I could about it, constantly thinking about it, and even dreaming about it. There have been so many great developments this year that I believe anyone who doesn't understand bitcoin is missing out on what change their life.

<h2>Four reasons to <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Bitcoin</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bitcoin is the easiest way to send and receive money online.</li>
    <li>Bitcoin is designed to retain value. A US dollar in 1900 has 4 cents of purchasing power today. Money should retain value like gold.</li>
    <li>Bitcoin is early in its life and has the potential to reach a market cap thousands of times higher than where it is now. Today's investors might be like the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/man-buys-bitcoin-forgets-about-it-remembers-finds-a-fortune-2013-10" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">guy</a> who invested $27 into Bitcoin and had over $500,000 a couple years later.</li>
    <li>Bitcoin protects us from our governments giving us freedom of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/08/20/wikileaks-bypasses-financial-blockade-with-bitcoin/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">expression</a>, enabling us to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/07/12/kim-dotcoms-pretrial-legal-funds-would-be-safe-with-bitcoin/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">defend</a> ourselves, and allowing us to avoid <a href="http://forexmagnates.com/bitcoins-soar-in-value-in-argentina-due-to-capital-control-laws-bitcoin-meetup-held-in-nations-capital/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">capital controls</a>.</li>
