The New York dept. of financial services proposed BitLicense [regulations](http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr1407171-vc.pdf) could [hurt bitcoin](http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/92143258184/bitcoin-at-a-crossroads-tackling-the-bitlicense) if enacted, especially if taken up by other states.

I know many in the bitcoin community think bitcoin is above regulation. It is true math can't be regulated out of existence. **However** entrepreneurs, consumers, and venture capitalists will not engage if bitcoin is illegal. This means a smaller network, less entrepreneurs, and less resources making the world a better place.

I agree with [Bruce Fenton](http://www.fentonreport.com/news/bitcoin-why-engage-with-ben-lawsky), that the most effective way to impact the regulations is to contact Ben Lawsky's boss and our own elected representatives.

Prevent the BitLicense:

 1. Support (retweet, share, etc.) media discussing the BitLicense problems.
 2. Sign this change.org [petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/governor-andrew-m-cuomo-and-the-new-york-state-legislature-stop-bitlicense-from-harming-small-businesses-and-tech-innovation-in-ny) asking NY Governor Andrew Cuomo to stop the BitLicense from harming small businesses.
 3. Find your elected representatives by [zip code](http://votesmart.org/).
 4. Write or call them to express your concerns about this infringement on interstate commerce. Here is an example statement:

	 > As a concerned member of your district I'm writing you about the BitLicense proposed by New York's department of financial services.
	 >
	 > My reading of the proposed license makes me concerned New York is trying to project it's influence on the rest of the country and globe in regulating interstate commerce. From my research it will be costly for me to comply with New York's regulations.
	 > 
	 > I'm further concerned that other states or countries will follow New York's lead and attempt to pass their own regulations further increasing compliance costs and stifling small businesses like mine with burdensome expenses that do nothing but hinder innovation and eliminate jobs.

 5. Express your concerns to New York governor Andrew Cuomo [here](http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact/GovernorContactForm.php). Here is an example statement:

	 > Governor, I am concerned about the proposed NYDFS BitLicense, it's impact on my ability to service New Yorkers, and it's constitutionality.
	 >
	 > Bitcoin and related technologies represent what may be as great a benefit to society as the Internet. The proposed BitLicense regulations are an attempt to regulate a global tool of commerce at a local level. This may result in New York citizens being blocked from participating in one of the greatest human inventions at best, or at worst stifle this nascent technology through patchwork and inconsistent regulations and preventing this technological breakthrough from benefiting humanity.
	 >
	 > I have already contacted my congressional representatives about this unconstitutional obstruction of interstate commerce. If the proposed regulations are enacted I plan on blocking New Yorkers from using my services and supporting court challenges to the license. 
 
Repeal the BitLicense:

 1. Bitcoin services ban New York Users by IP address and point them to a page asking them to contact their elected officials to fix their law.
 2. Support (financially) court challenges of the BitLicense
 3. Support (retweet, share, etc.) media discussing the BitLicense problems.
