# Things to consider

 1. Don't buy too much. Bitcoin is great but it is also volatile. Don't fret about buying as much as you'd spend on a cup of coffee, but if you are thinking about buying a small car's worth or farm's worth, make sure you understand the risks.
 2. Bitcoin is fun. Get a wallet app and pay your friends back in bitcoin when you split lunch.
 3. Try out fun services like [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/) and get a discount for purchases through [Purse](https://purse.io/)
