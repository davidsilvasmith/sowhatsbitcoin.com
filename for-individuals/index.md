* <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> **Fast** - Bitcoin moves anywhere in the world as fast as email.

* <i class="fa fa-signal"></i>  **Rare** - There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever. Luckily bitcoins are very divisible. Everyone can have some, but not a lot.

* <i class="fa fa-money"></i> **Counterfeit-proof** - Bitcoin is the safest way to get paid. Bitcoins cannot be counterfeit and payments cannot be reversed. Many criminals will be out of a job when bitcoin becomes mainstream.

* <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> **Not a Bureaucratic Tool** - Bitcoin's creators designed it as a safe way for people to store wealth. It is a deflationary currency instead of the inflationary currencies most people are used to. Additional bitcoins cannot be created to fund wars, pay political allies, or erode consumer savings. 


#### <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> Why would I want bitcoins?
* <i class="fa fa-level-up"></i> Each Bitcoin could be worth a lot more than it is today in the future.  The primary reason to buy bitcoins today is as an investment. Bitcoin has the potential to change every financial transaction in the world. If it only achieves a fraction of it's potential bitcoin will be worth many times more than it is today. Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Chris Dixon believes even as much as <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/chrisdixon/">$100,000 per bitcoin</a>.
* <i class="fa fa-credit-card"></i> Issues with credit cards, banks, or cash? Everyone can use bitcoin. No application process required.


#### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Why wouldn't I want to own bitcoins?
* <i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i> Your bitcoin investment could end up worthless. Created in 2009, bitcoin is a new technology. No one knows if bitcoin will succeed or not. It is a network. As more people use bitcoin, bitcoin becomes more valuable. Bitcoin will be a huge success or a huge failure.
* <i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i> Hackers may try to steal your bitcoins.
* If you have access to banking services, credit cards, and debit cards bitcoin won't do much for you today. Although that is changing with the emergence of services like [ChangeTip].
