Who controls bitcoin? 
: Bitcoin is controlled by the users of the system. New software changes must be voluntarily accepted by bitcoin users.

How are bitcoins made?
: Bitcoins are created through a process called mining. The best way to think of it is like a lottery that gives out a prize (bitcoin) every ten minutes. The more tickets someone has the higher their chance of winning. The major difference is that instead of lottery tickets it is computing power (technically hashing power) that gives a chance to win. The more power the more chance of winning.

How are bitcoins safe?
: Bitcoin payments can't be reversed. Bitcoins can't be counterfeit. This makes bitcoin the best way to take payment. For example if you are selling a car or a boat on Craigslist. No need to worry about getting scammed. Once you've received the payment it is yours.
