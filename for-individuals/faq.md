Who made bitcoin?
: No one knows who made bitcoin. Someone(s) going by the alias [*Satoshi Nakamoto*](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/) released released bitcoin in 2009. It is definately strange not to know who created the best money on the planet. However most people don't know who created email. That doesn't stop email from being a vital part of today's world.

Who controls bitcoin? 
: Users of the bitcoin system control it. Bitcoin users must voluntarily accept new software changes. Another way to think about it is the way Word processing works. No one has to use a particular version of software and no one has to upgrade ever, but everyone on the same version knows they can work together. That is similar to how bitcoin works.

How are bitcoins made?
: Bitcoins are created through a process called mining. The best way to think of it is like a lottery that gives out a prize (bitcoin) every ten minutes. The more tickets someone has the higher their chance of winning. The major difference is that instead of lottery tickets it is computing power (technically hashing power) that gives a chance to win. The more power the more chance of winning.

How are bitcoins safe?
: Bitcoin payments can't be reversed. Bitcoins can't be counterfeit. This makes bitcoin the best way to take payment. For example if you are selling a car or a boat on Craigslist. No need to worry about getting scammed. Once you've received the payment it is yours.

Is bitcoin anonymous?
: No. A good way to think about anonymity is to think about email. On first glance it seems anonymous, but law enforcement organizations have tools to identify the owners of email accounts. Bitcoin is actually more public than email. Every bitcoin transaction is visible to everyone in the world. However a person can create as many bitcoin accounts as they want. Therefore even though the transactions are publicly visible, observers will not know who owns an account without additional information.
