Bitcoin will benefit some of the poorest people in a variety of ways:


## Today
 * Someone unable to get a bank account, like  [Africa][africaUnbanked], can have bank-like services through bitcoin. They can accept payment for services rendered anywhere in the world without fees.
 * Providing an escape for everyday people from the impact of high-inflation in countries like [Argentina][ArgentinaInflation]

## Coming Soon
 * Cheap remittances - bitcoin is expected to lower the 10% fees on the [$500 billion][500B] remitted annually. Bitcoin service [Rebit.ph](https://rebit.ph/) reduces this fee to [1%][lowFee].
 * Crowdfunding without fees
 * IPOs without banks 
 * Donations with lower fees - bitcoin donations and conversions to government issued currency cost less than PayPal, Western Union, Kiva, etc.
